# 🎨 App Icon Creation Guide for App Store Submission

## 📱 Why You Need a Proper App Icon

App Store **requires** a proper app icon for submission. Without it, your app will be rejected. The icon appears in:
- App Store search results
- User's home screen
- App switcher
- Settings app
- Spotlight search

## 🎯 Icon Requirements

- **Size**: 1024x1024 pixels (exactly)
- **Format**: PNG
- **Background**: Solid color (no transparency)
- **Design**: No rounded corners (iOS adds them automatically)
- **Quality**: High resolution, crisp edges
- **Branding**: Should represent your app clearly

## 🚀 Quick Creation Steps

## 🎨 Design Tips

- **Use your brand color** (`#249096`) as background
- **Center your logo** prominently
- **Ensure readability** at small sizes
- **Test on both light and dark backgrounds**
- **Keep it simple** - complex designs don't scale well
- **No text** unless it's part of your logo

## 📁 File Structure

Your icon should be placed at:
```
coaching-mobile/
└── assets/
    └── icon.png  ← Place your icon here
```

## 🔧 Current Configuration

Your `app.json` is already configured to use:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "ios": {
      "icon": "./assets/icon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **File exists**: `assets/icon.png` should be present
2. **Correct size**: 1024x1024 pixels
3. **PNG format**: File extension is `.png`
4. **No transparency**: Background should be solid
5. **High quality**: Image should be crisp and clear

## 🚀 Building After Icon Creation

Once you have your `icon.png` file:

```bash
# Build for iOS App Store
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Or build for both platforms
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Icon not showing in build
- Ensure file is named exactly `icon.png`
- Check file is in `assets/` folder
- Verify file size is 1024x1024 pixels
- Make sure file is not corrupted

### Build errors
- Check file permissions
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Verify EAS CLI is up to date

### Icon looks blurry
- Use original high-resolution source
- Don't scale up from smaller images
- Export at exactly 1024x1024 pixels
