# Mobile App Notification Fix

## Problem Description

The mobile app was receiving notifications for old users due to incomplete notification token cleanup during user logout and switching. The issue was:

1. **Incomplete Token Cleanup**: Old notification tokens were only marked as `is_active: false` instead of being completely removed
2. **Token Persistence**: Old tokens remained in the database and could still receive notifications
3. **Missing Logout Cleanup**: Tokens weren't properly cleaned up when users switched accounts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Token Cleanup
- **Preserves Current User Tokens**: The current logged-in user keeps their notification tokens active
- **Removes Old User Tokens**: Only tokens from other users are cleaned up
- **Ensures Notifications Work**: Current user can still receive notifications when the app is closed

### 2. Enhanced User Switching Logic
- Added token cleanup when users switch accounts in `AuthContext`
- Only removes tokens from the previous user, not the current user
- Tokens are cleaned up before new ones are initialized

### 3. Session Startup Cleanup
- Added `cleanupLeftoverTokens()` function that runs when the app starts
- Removes any leftover tokens from other users while preserving current user tokens
- Ensures no old tokens remain from previous sessions

### 4. Improved Logout Process
- Enhanced `signOut()` function to clean up tokens only when actually signing out
- Current user tokens remain active until logout is confirmed
- Ensures proper cleanup even if the logout process fails

## New Functions Added

### `cleanupNotificationTokens(userId: string)`
- Completely removes all notification tokens for a specific user
- **Safety Check**: Won't remove tokens if the user ID matches the current session
- Used during logout and user switching

### `cleanupLeftoverTokens()`
- Cleans up any leftover tokens from other users when the app starts
- **Preserves Current User**: Keeps the current user's tokens active
- Called automatically during authentication state changes

### `smartCleanupTokens()`
- **Smart Cleanup**: Only removes tokens for users other than the current user
- **Preserves Notifications**: Current user can still receive notifications
- Useful for manual cleanup without affecting current user

### `debugCleanupAllTokens(userId: string)`
- Debug function to manually clean up all tokens for a user
- **Use with Caution**: This removes ALL tokens including current user's
- Useful for troubleshooting notification issues

### `checkNotificationTokenStatus()`
- Shows current notification token status for debugging
- Displays platform, type, and status information

## Debug Tools

The `NotificationTestButton` component now includes four buttons:

1. **üß™ Test Notification** - Sends a test notification
2. **üîç Check Status** - Shows current token status and count
3. **üß† Smart Cleanup** - Removes tokens from OTHER users while preserving YOUR tokens ‚≠ê
4. **üßπ Debug Cleanup** - Manually removes ALL tokens for troubleshooting (use carefully)

## How It Works Now

### For Current Users
- ‚úÖ **Tokens Preserved**: Your notification tokens remain active
- ‚úÖ **Notifications Work**: You can receive notifications when the app is closed
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup**: Old user tokens are automatically removed

### For User Switching
- üîÑ **Smart Cleanup**: Only removes tokens from the previous user
- üîÑ **Preserves New User**: New user's tokens are kept active
- üîÑ **No Interruption**: Notifications continue working for the new user

### For App Startup
- üßπ **Leftover Cleanup**: Removes tokens from other users
- üßπ **Current User Safe**: Your tokens are preserved
- üßπ **Fresh Start**: Ensures clean token state

## How to Use

### For Users
- The fixes are automatic - no action needed
- **Your notifications will continue working** when the app is closed
- Old user tokens are automatically cleaned up

### For Developers
1. **Check Token Status**: Use the "Check Status" button to see current token information
2. **Smart Cleanup**: Use "Smart Cleanup" to remove old user tokens safely
3. **Debug Issues**: Use "Debug Cleanup" only if you need to reset everything
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check console logs for cleanup operations

### For Testing
1. Log in with User A
2. Check token status (should show tokens)
3. Log out
4. Log in with User B
5. Check token status (should show only User B's tokens)
6. **Verify User B can still receive notifications when app is closed**

## Database Changes

The fix changes how tokens are handled:
- **Before**: Tokens were marked `is_active: false` (soft delete)
- **After**: Tokens are completely deleted (hard delete) **BUT only for old users**
- **Current User**: Tokens remain active and functional

This ensures no old tokens can accidentally receive notifications while preserving the current user's ability to receive notifications.

## Monitoring

Check the console logs for these messages:
- `üßπ Cleaning up notification tokens for old user: [userId]`
- `‚úÖ Notification tokens completely removed for old user: [userId]`
- `üîÑ User switching detected, cleaning up old user tokens`
- `üßπ Checking for leftover notification tokens...`
- `‚úÖ Current user has [X] active notification tokens`
- `üß† Performing smart token cleanup...`

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience notification issues:

1. **Use "Check Status"** to see current token count
2. **Use "Smart Cleanup"** to remove old user tokens safely
3. **Use "Debug Cleanup"** only as a last resort (removes all tokens)
4. **Restart the app** to re-initialize notifications
5. **Check console logs** for any error messages

## Security Notes

- Token cleanup only affects the currently authenticated user's old tokens
- No tokens from other users can be accessed or modified
- All operations require valid authentication
- Current user tokens are always preserved until logout

## Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Current user notifications work when app is closed**  
‚úÖ **Old user tokens are automatically cleaned up**  
‚úÖ **No more notifications for wrong users**  
‚úÖ **Smart cleanup preserves active functionality**  
‚úÖ **Automatic operation requires no user action**
